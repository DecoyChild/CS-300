# CS-300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The main issue that I was solving was to read from a CSV file into a dataStructure.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the issue in a modular fashion. Solving one peice at a time. Then putting each piece together to build a working program.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Debugging each section as problems arise. Rather than programming large chunks. is easier to solve multplie small issues than one really big issue.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project improved my planning approach. It was far easier to pave the way using flow charts and / or pseudocode.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
